# personalwebsite
My personal website, which will eventually showcase my programming projects, videos, and documentations/blogs that follow what I've been working on regarding the website (or any other side project).

Feel free to download this template if you're interested in building a website of your own! I'll be commenting my code in a way that easily conveys what each specific function is doing.

Please run pip on requirments.txt in order to properly launch the website.
