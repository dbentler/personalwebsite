My personal portfolio/devblog site, created with Flask, Bootstrap, and HTML5.

The website is currently hosted on the Google App Engine, which is linked to this repository to automatically update whenever a new push to main is created.

Local development currently takes place on my PC, with changes being pushed when features are complete. These are currently whenever a new HTML5 page is ready, or whenever a major backend change happens.

## Versioning
Versioning follows the following format:

    <major>.<minor>
Where `<major>` is reserved for massive front-end changes (ie, site layout) and `<minor>` is reserved for new page updates or changes to gcloud specific files or images being added/changed.

## Planned Features

 - Add dynamic content (like a small little cryptographic puzzle inspired by the ones created by Cicada-3301).
 - Markup Renderer for Project pages.
 - Devblogs to illustrate what I've been working on.

## Devblog
The devblog can be found here, which documents version 1.0 to version 2.3:
