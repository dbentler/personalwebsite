        Hello there! My name is Darren Bentler. I'm a 20 year old Computer Science and Engineering major at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, and I currently reside in Long Island, New York.
        The website is still in active development as I'm writing this (I created it within 2 hours on March 13th, 2021.) So of course it's going to be rough around the edges a bit.
        I'm sure you've had one of several thoughts pop into your head upon reaching this home page. I'll try to address them now:
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="center_text">
        <h2>"Why did you create it?"</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="justify_text">
        <p>
            The purpose of this website is to be a place where I can show off what I've been working on and what I have created in an organized - efficient layout. Recruiters who are wondering what I'm capable of could go to "Projects", select "Programming" and see a list of work along with information
            regarding why I took time to create them, and how they were applied in a real world setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website itself is one of those projects. I started working on it on March 12th, 2021 in order to learn/better understand both front-end and back-end web-development. The backend is currently being handled by Flask, a web-application written in Python.
        </p>
        <p>
            The source code of the website can be found on my github, which you can find **here** or via the navigation bar up top.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="center_text">
        <h2>
            "Why does it look so barebones/bad/terrible?"
        </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="justify_text">
        <p>
            Fair question. When I started this website, I had little expierence with HTML, CSS, Flask, etc. I'm also not that much of a visual designer. That being said, I wanted to challenge myself and create this website from the ground up.
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn't want to use a free bootstrap CSS template, nor did I want to have any unnecessary animations, like logos of programming languages I'm experienced in flying in (or fading in) to the center of the page. Nor did I want some infinite scroll feature in which
            those animations would play as you scroll further down the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I do enjoy a good looking webpage - I also believe there tends to be a degree of "overdesigning" - or "overdelivery" in modern web-development when it comes to getting your message across.
        </p>
        <p>
            My message to you is "Here's some stuff I've made, come check it out. Impressed? Here's a way to contact me!". I don't need any fancy animations or pop-ins to show you that. I, as the designer, want you, the user, to access all of this information as easily and quickly as possible.
            Which I'm sure is something you also wish to do as well. 

            And hence, the website sure doesn't look the best. (However: I may add a "Design" category to show that I am, in fact, capable of creating such a website.)
