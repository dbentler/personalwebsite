# https://www.darrenbentler.com/
My personal portfolio/devblog site, created with Flask, Bootstrap, and HTML5.

The website is currently hosted on the Google App Engine, which is linked to this repository to automatically update whenever a new push/merge to main is created.

# Development
Development currently takes place on the websiteDev branch. Here, I work on implementing new features or changing layouts. Whenever I'm done with a feature, whether it be an article or CSS change, I merge the changes into the "main" branch. You can preview these changes by cloning that respitory and running the site locally.

# Website Roadmap
With the Summer of 2021 coming to a close and my life slowing down, I plan on continuing updating and adding features to the website. If you'd like to know what these changes are, you can find the roadmap of features
