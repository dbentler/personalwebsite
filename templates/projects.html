                My cryptocurrency adventure with C++. Through this project, I work on creating a working blockchain, implement proof of work, and I eventually
                expand my scope to process transactions. My eventual end goal is for the cryptocurrency to be a medium of exchange that could be traded for virtual
                goods outside of the scope of a game. Think if you were to use Monopoly Play Money in Settlers of Catan for trades.

                Kind of like a devblog for the website. You get to see some early screenshots of the website before I started "website2.0", an overhaul of the front-end.
                Here I go over what I learned from making this website, along with thoughts of expansion and possibly my plans for dynamic content.

                My implementation of the "Petals Around the Rose" game. 
                To quote wikipedia, "Petals Around the Rose is a mathematically challenging puzzle in which the object is to work out the formula by which a number is derived from the roll of a set of five or six dice".
                A simple concept, and fun game to mess with your friends with (if you figure it out of course).<br><br>
                It's not as impressive as some other things on this list, but it holds a special place in my heart as the first semi-complex C++ program I wrote that compiled out of the box.

                A series of Minecraft game servers, the LoneWolves Network came to be originally from the youtuber "Jeremy". It shut down in 2015,
                and with Jeremy's permission/blessing, my friends and I started a passion project to revive it since Minecraft was trending again.
                We quickly grew past our initial goals. Before we knew it, we had a player base and community of hundreds of players. <br><br>

                I was the face of the server to our players, and I worked on implementing features via plugins built with the Spigot API. I also was in
                charge of server management, and I migrated the server over to an OVH box and performed maintence. <br><br>

                At the end of our run, we had generated $21,000 USD in revenue and exceeded the Discord server member limit (1,000 back in 2019).
