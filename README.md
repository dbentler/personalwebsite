# personalwebsite
My personal website, which will eventually showcase my programming projects, videos, and documentations/blogs that follow what I've been working on regarding the website (or any other side project).

Feel free to download this template if you're interested in building a website of your own! I'll be commenting my code in a way that easily conveys what each specific function is doing.

The backend is written in Python, specifically with Flask. If you want to host the website locally, you'll need to have the following modules installed:
FLASK
FLASK_NAV
