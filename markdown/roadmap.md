# Website Roadmap

Here is the website roadmap.

## By Winter, 2021:
- Flesh out About page some more. Add "Currently Reading", "Currently Listening", and "Currently Learning".
- Begin conversion to full markdown of static pages: Home, Projects, Contact, and About.

## By Spring, 2022:
- Add more photos and personality to the website as a whole. It's *very* bland to look at right now.
- Fix the issue where the footer refuses to stick to the bottom of the page it is on.
- Add a Blog. Will anyone read it? Probably not. But c'mon, it's a personal website!

## Unknown Deadlines
- Personal Video
- Dynamic Content
- Add more secrets and easter eggs. Encourage people who visit to explore!
- Maybe add a video archive of what I've made before?
- Update banner.
