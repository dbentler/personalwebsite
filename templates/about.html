                Hey there! As you already (hopefully) know, my name is Darren Bentler. I'm a 21 year old ex-barista, and aspiring software engineer from South Huntington, New York. <br><br>

                Whether you're a potential employer who wants to know more about who me, or an old friend who's curious on what I'm up to these days, feel free to read! <br> <br>
                Also, if you have any feedback on the website or just want to get in touch, feel free to contact me via email or through a text/phone call (both can be found at the bottom of the home page). <br> <br>

                <i>I plan on eventually adding an "About Me" video here at some point to better illustrate who I am sometime in the future.</i>

                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                I'm a hard working and self-driven, 21 year old raised on Long Island in South Huntington, New York. <br><br>

                I recognize the importance of teamwork and efficiency in the work place, but I'm also not afraid to ask for help
                or for a second opinion. <br><br>

                Professionally, I strive to put forth my best work and self in order to achieve goals and keep team morale high. I thrive 
                in both team and solo environments, and I love to get to know both who I'm working with, and who I'm working for. <br><br>

                I also believe in engaging with others in meaningful and impactful ways.<br><br>

                            <ul style="font-size: 19px;">
                                <li>My favorite color is <strong style="color: red;">red</strong>.</li>
                                <li>I used to be a Barista. My favorite coffee blend is currently Starbuck Reserve's "Whiskey Barrel Aged Cold Brew".</li>
                                <li>Despite getting into it late, I'm a big fan of the MCU. From the MCU, my favorite character is Tony Stark/Iron Man.</li>
                                <li>I like rock climbing, but I'm pretty bad at it. I can barely do a V3.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Despite being a Tony Stark/Iron Man fan, my favorite MCU movie is "Guardians of the Galaxy".</li>
                                <li>I wanted to be an astronomer when I was little since space fascinated me so much back then. It still fascinates me today.</li>
                                <li>I'm plagued with the "finding a new song and listening to it on repeat until you get sick of it" disease, which sucks because I wanted to put my favorite song here.</li>
                                <li>I have a pet rabbit named Lucy! At the time of writing this, she's currently 4 years old.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>When it comes to nerd stuff (well, besides the MCU), I'm a huge fan of the Halo universe.</li>
                                <li>The first program I ever wrote was basically a backdoor to a Minecraft server.</li>
                                <li>Friends would review me as: "A more tame Michael Reeves", "Like a stupid Tony Stark", and "I don't want to say anything for you to put up on your stupid website, Darren".</li>
